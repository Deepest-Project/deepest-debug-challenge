# Deepest Debug Challenge: can you squash them all?

WARNING: this model is implemented to NOT work correcly. DO NOT use this for your application. It will hurt you.

This is a quiz code for debugging a badly-implemented neural network.

The code runs fine and trains the model somehow, but not correctly.

You are given a task to fix all the ML-logical bugs in the code.

## How to challenge yourself

Run train.py to train and test the model.

## Constraints

1. Do not use batch normalization.

2. Do not add network parameters. i.e. Do not stack more layers naively. It won't help.
